# Classic Fog (Resource Pack)

This resource pack makes distance fog look ~~good~~ like how it used to back in the alpha days.

It only changes the fog in the overworld, other dimensions are not affected.

Thanks to my friend [flamesatgames](https://youtube.com/flamesatgames) for requesting this, I had so much fun making it!
